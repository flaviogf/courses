* Objectives
+ Install, configure, and administer an Elasticsearch cluster
+ Index your data, optimize your indices, and search with the Elasticsearch query language
+ Discover trends, patterns, and anomalies with aggregation and the machine learning APIs

* What is Elasticsearch?
+ For search and analysis
+ Elasticsearch is the distributed search and analytics engine at the heart of the Elastic Stack
+ Kibana enables you to interactively explore, visualize, and share insightes into your data and manage and monitor the stack
+ Elasticsearch is where the indexing, search and analysis magic happens
+ Elasticsearch provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data
+ Structured text
+ Unstructured text
+ Numerical data
+ Geospatial data
+ While not every problem is a search problem, Elasticsearch offers speed and flexibility to handle data in a wide variety of use cases:
  - Add a search box to an app or website
  - Store and analyze logs, metrics, and security event data
  - Use machine learning to automatically model the behavior of your data in real time
  - Automate business workflow using Elasticsearch as a storage engine
  - Manage, integrate, and analyze spatial information using Elasticsearch as a geographic information system (GIS)
  - Store and process genetic data using Elasticsearch as a bioinformatics research tool
